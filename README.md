React memory game

This is a simple memory game. Click a card that you haven't clicked on to get the top score. Each time you click on a card you previously clicked, the current game is reset and total failed guesses goes up by one.

For fun you can switch the suit you can play with by clicking on the suit name in the header.

This is a basic React app that has a number of components and uses a Higher Order Component for fading in cards on game start.
